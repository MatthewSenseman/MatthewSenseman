    "1. There are several instances where my own bias is added. Such as when I define what range of HHsize and HHcomp can be assigned to. Also when defining age ranges of individuals to be assigned. This allows for a not truly random pick from the distributions, but I think it is necessary to include. i.e. I narrowed age ranges for households with no children so that only adults were included. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because there are arbitrary categories of HHsize and HHcomp, it is not possible to correctly match individuals into HHs. So these HHs with their individuals become the 'probable' households in the MSOA based on the distribution of the data. Without the original de-anonymized version of the data (whihc isn't released for 100 years), there is no way to know for certain the exact age/sex makeup (and sometimes size) of the 'real-life' HHs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If communal HHs or HHs with more than 8 people exist in the MSOA, then knowing which of the '8 or more' HHs has a bunch of people is very difficult to determine. My probability function above is likely not accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Because of the random element of assigning individuals into HHs, each time this code file is ran, a slighlty different assortment of HHs (i.e. individuals of different ages or sexes) are created and assigned into the df.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The employment status category is a bit vague because of how that census table was formatted."
